Szip uses a limited order Sort transform. This transformation is related to
the Burrows-Wheeler transformation used in blocksorting compression methods.
See http://www.compressconsult.com/st/ for more information.
The difference is a fast, deterministic behaviour in time at some compression
loss. And you could easily do it in hardware. 

As next step it uses a probability model for blocksorted files.

The last step is entropy encoding using a range coder. This coder is based on
an article by G.N.N. Martin published in 1979 and is belived to be patent-free.
More info, including a GNU GPL sourcecode, can be found on
http://www.compressconsult.com/rangecoder/
Moving to github and changing license to Apache2.0 is in progress.


The compressed format supports multiple files including creation, modification
and accesstime, owner, group and protection. However the *program* does not
support it; if you want to contribute code doing that you are welcome.
